### What is Wavelength (Digital Version)? 

Wavelength (Digital Version) is an offline digital recreation of the game Wavelength, scaled down to bite size as a simple arcade game. The main differences between the original game and this version is that the digital version is singleplayer, however that's a compromise that had to have been made due to the general scope and also being my first game in a new game engine, Godot. Regardless, I think the game is fun when you try it out, with 50 hints to keep you going, so give it a shot!


### How to Play

On the screen, you can see a dial, a card, and a hint at the bottom. Your goal is to get the dial as close as possible to a hidden target on the board. The card shows two opposites, one on the left side and one on the right, and the hint below them shows where the target would be if placed in that spectrum. For example, if the card had natural on the left side and man made on the right side, then if the hint was a forest, you could make a guess that the target is all the way on the left side. To choose a spot, turn the dial to whichever location you think the target is in by hovering over it, then left click to see the result.  How close the target is to the middle determines how many points you get, with yellow giving you 2 points, orange giving you 3, and blue giving you 4.
